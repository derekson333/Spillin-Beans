## How It Works
When users get to the homepage they are greeted with other users profiles and recipes they've created. If the user clicks the recipe, they are prompted to login, or create an account. After creating an account or logging in, users are able to make save their own recipes. Recipes include a name, description, cook time, prep time, ingredients, a picture, and instructions to make it.
